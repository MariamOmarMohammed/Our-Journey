            <p>
              Receiving that acceptance email was such an incredible moment
              for me. It felt like all the hard work and dedication I've put
              into pursuing this opportunity had finally paid off. Thinking
              back on the journey that led me here, I'm reminded of the
              challenges I faced and the obstacles I had to overcome. But
              through perseverance and determination, I stayed focused on my
              goal.
              <br /><br />
              Now, with this acceptance in hand, I feel a surge of excitement
              and anticipation for what lies ahead. It's a validation of my
              efforts and a reminder of the endless possibilities waiting for
              me. I can't wait to embark on this new chapter of my life,
              filled with growth, learning, and unforgettable experiences

              Studying at the Code Like a Girl program has been an empowering
              and transformative experience for me. Immersed in a supportive
              environment, I've delved into the intricate world of coding,
              breaking down barriers and stereotypes. The program not only
              imparts technical skills but fosters a sense of community,
              encouraging collaboration and the celebration of diverse
              perspectives.
              <br /><br />
              Through challenging projects and insightful mentorship, I've
              honed my coding prowess, embracing the ethos of coding with
              confidence and resilience. Code Like a Girl has not just
              equipped me with coding proficiency but has instilled in me a
              passion for pushing boundaries and shaping the future of
              technology with a unique feminine touch.
